      "content": "The ancient library of Alexandria, which served as the intellectual and cultural hub of Egypt for 250 years, was tragically destroyed in 43 BC in a fire. Now there is widespread speculation about its true beginnings. The most popular theory is that Ptolemy I, who ruled from 304 to 282 BC, gathered a vast selection of kingship, ruling and world's people so he might understand better trade terms and how to lead his subjects.\n\nPtolemy longed to possess all the literature in the world. The manuscripts took the form of scrolls kept in pigeonholes, the best of them wrapped in jackets of leather or linen. They were likely to have remained in the groups in which they were acquired, rather than being properly categorized. Parchment paper wasn't used until later when the first books began to be written and kept in wooden chests in Roman times.\n\nAs the library expanded, Ptolemy's successors used many unethical methods to obtain manuscripts. One source claims that every ship sailing into Alexandria's harbor was carefully searched and if a book was found, it would be confiscated and taken to the library. At the library, it was examined and a decision would be made whether to keep it or make a replacement copy to return to the owner with some reimbursement or just return the original copy if the book is not valuable enough.",
